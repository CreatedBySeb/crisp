# crisp - CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust

***C**HIP-8 **R**ust **I**nterpreter and **S**imulator **P**rogram*

I wrote this initially as a hobby project over Winter 2023-24 in order to learn Rust and the basics of emulation programming, without following a guide. Over time, I hope to develop this to be a fully-fledged emulator, and then use it as a base for other emulation projects.

## Usage

crisp does not have a GUI, currently you invoke it by running it with the path to a CHIP-8 ROM

`./crisp <path-to-rom>`

## Supported Functionality

- [X] CHIP-8 instructions
- [ ] SUPER-CHIP instructions
- [ ] XO-CHIP instructions
- [ ] Configuration
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Assembler
